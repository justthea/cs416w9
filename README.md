Lifestyle Diseases Visualization

Overview
This project presents an interactive narrative visualization of the trends in common lifestyle diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. Developed using D3.js, it is designed to educate users about the growing impact of lifestyle choices on health, using a Martini Glass narrative structure to guide users through a series of informative scenes.

Technologies Used
	•	D3.js: Utilized for creating dynamic, interactive data visualizations.
	•	topoJSON: Used for rendering geographical data, particularly in mapping regional variations in disease prevalence.
 
Narrative Structure
The project uses a Martini Glass narrative structure, beginning with a guided, linear narrative that introduces key data and insights, and concluding with an interactive exploratory section. This structure allows users to first understand the foundational data and then engage actively with the data to explore various "what-if" scenarios regarding lifestyle changes.

How to Use
Navigate through the visualization by clicking on the forward and back arrows to move through the scenes. The visualization starts with an overview of increasing disease rates, followed by detailed views of risk factors and regional data. The final interactive section allows users to manipulate data variables to see potential impacts of lifestyle changes on disease prevalence.

Data Sources
Data for this visualization is sourced from trusted national health databases, including:
	•	Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): Provides data on disease prevalence and risk factors in the U.S.
	•	World Health Organization (WHO): Offers global data on health-related metrics, enhancing the scope of our analysis.
